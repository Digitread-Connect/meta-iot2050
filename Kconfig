config IMAGE_EXAMPLE

	  This is the official example image with several tools as well as
	  Node-RED preinstalled. It comes without a graphical user interface.

	bool "LXDE example image"
	help
	  Based on the example image, this adds an LXDE-based graphical user
	  interface.

config IMAGE_BOOT
	bool "Firmware image"
	help
	  Build the firmware image that is responsible for booting the device.

	  WARNING: Do not flash this image onto your device unless you know
	  that it fits AND you have an external flash programmer at hand that
	  allows to recover. Otherwise you risk to BRICK THE IOT2050!
